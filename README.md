# **Stock Analysis - VBA Challenge**


## Purpose of Analysis

Effectively analyze and evaluate the given stocks to best help in investment desicion making.

Steve wants to know how the favored stock of his parents (DQ) performed between the years 2017-2018. Though his parents were
initially interested in DQ stock, Steve has decided to go further is depth to show his parents clear analysis of better stock options.
to do so we are providing the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. 

Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how 
actively a stock is traded. 

The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from 
the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 


With the Macro created we identified stocks that had positive yearly return and were able to get an idea of how often they were traded.

##Results:

Provided below are the *executuion time* outputs for the refactored code:

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

An advantage to refactoring code is making the run time faster.This is important 
when working with extremely large datasets and efficient in general when working with any expanded dataset. 

Another advantage is improving the logic of the code which can make it easier for future users to read the Macro. 

Refactoring an intricate code could lead to malfunction if there is a mistep. 




## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

In reference to learning - refactoring code was a great learning experience. 
It was in continuously receiving errors in turn I was able to identify and better understand unneccesary code.
I was forced to revisit each line multiple times while working on the refactoring Challenge.
It led me to some confusuion and lost time when having to start anew from the original code to understand misteps. It also led to scewed data when done incorrectly.
